 1. Lilypond.app is in the ~/Applications folder.  To run the lilypond command use
    the following command-line option.

    ~/Applications/Lilypond.app/Content/Resources/bin/lilypond tst.ly

    In .vimrc set the following:
    autocmd BufRead,BufWinEnter,BufNewFile *.ly set makeprg=~/Applications/Lilypond.app/Content/Resources/bin/lilypond\ \"%\"

 2. Lilypond file is structured like this:
    \version "2.18.2"
    \header { }
    \book {
      \score { 
         ... compund music expression %%% ALL MUSIC GOES HERE 
         \layout { } % how to layout music in pdf
         \midi { } % properties for midi output
      }
    }

    See:
    http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/learning/introduction-to-the-lilypond-file-structure

 3. Every \book block creates a separate output file (e.g. pdf or midi)
    Every \score block is a separate chunk of music within \book block.
    Every \layout block affects the \score or \book block in which it appears.

    \layout, \header, \midi blocks can occur outside the \score block!

 4. A \score block must contain _exactly one_ music expression.

 5. Use << ... >> to show simultaneous music.  It is needed when there are
    multiple staves!  For e.g.

    \score {
      <<
        \new Staff = "singer" << \new Voice = "vocal" { c'1 } >>
        \new PianoStaff = "piano" <<
          \new Staff = "upper" { c'1 }
          \new Staff = "lower" { c'1 }
        >>
      >>
      \layout { }
    }

 6. Different bracket types and their functions

    Bracket type          Function
    { ... }           Encloses a sequential segment of music
    < ... >           Encloses the notes of a chord
    << ... >>         Encloses simultaneous music expressions
    ( ... )           Marks the start and end of slur
    \( ... \)         Marks the start and end of phrasing slur
    [ ... ]           Marks the start and end of a manual beam

 7. Comments start with %.  Comment blocks are %{ ... %}

 8. In Lilypond lowercase letters a through g represent note names and are engraved
    in the octave below middle C.  Hence it is customary to identify middle C with c' .  
    Also see, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28musical_note%29

 9. Some handy snippets
    See https://gist.github.com/tockrock/721686/e4df8e03ccc86eeda2fb96a20a1ca36d29066e05

    segno = \mark \markup { \musicglyph #"scripts.segno" }
    segnot =     ^\markup { \musicglyph #"scripts.segno" }
    coda =  \mark \markup { \musicglyph #"scripts.coda" }
    codat =      ^\markup { \musicglyph #"scripts.coda" }

    dsh = \mark \markup { \italic "D.S."} % D.S. Helper
    dch = \mark \markup { \italic "D.C."} % D.C. Helper
    dsafh = \mark \markup { \italic "D.S. al Fine"} % D.S. Al Fine Helper
    dcafh = \mark \markup { \italic "D.C. al Fine"} % D.C. Al Fine Helper

10. All Major scalles follow this exact pattern: W W H W W W H.
    W = whole, and H = half step

11. If you have to notate a pitch that has to be played in rapid succession (for e.g.,
    see the star_wars.ly file) that is called ``tremolo''.  You can typeset it
    by adding a :N after the note name in lilypond.  Try to typeset the following:

      c2:8 c:32 c: c:

    If N is omitted after the colon it uses the last value.

12. The name of variable must have *alphabetic characters ONLY*, no numbers, 
    underscores, or dashes.

    Variables must be defined *BEFORE* the main music expression.

13. Eighth notes in 3/4 time are beamed as full measure by default.  To beam eighth
    notes in 3/4 time on the beat, reset beamExceptions.

    \set Timing.beamExceptions = #'() % sets beam(1 1 1)

    See "korean_folk_song_variants.ly" for example of this usage.
    
14. Set the property showLastLength = R1*8 to show just the last 8 measures when
    you're typesetting.  This makes it easier to compile and debug the process.
    See http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/notation/skipping-corrected-music

15. s1 (or s2 or s3 ...) can be used as a spacer note.

16. Use ! or ? to show natural/sharp position of the pitch!  This is is especially
    useful if there's a natural note amidst a whole bunch of sharp notes!  For e.g.,
    if there's a f-natural in the d-major key it makes sense to explicitly show the
    natural sign using either ! or ? .  Lilypond does this automatically but sometimes
    extra notation is needed to provide reminders to musicians, especially novices
    like me!  

    The differene between ! and ? is that the natural/sharp sign is adorned inside 
    parenthesis when ? is used.

17. The letter 'I' is skipped for reherasal marks and this is in accordance with
    engraving traditions!! 
    http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/notation/bars#rehearsal-marks
    To include 'I' in rehearsal marks use one of the following commands:

    \set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-alphabet
    \set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-box-alphabet
    \set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-circle-alphabet

18. The BarNumber.break-visibility property, in Score context, permits printing bar
    numbers at places other than the start of line.  This property takes three values
    which may be set to #t or #f indicating visibility.  The order of the three values
    is: end-of-line, middle-of-line, and beginning-of-line.

    \override Score.BarNumber.break-visibility = ##(#t #t #t) %% all bar numbers visible!

19. Use barnumbers for mark formatting!
    \set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-barnumbers
    \set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-box-barnumbers
    \set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-circle-barnumbers
